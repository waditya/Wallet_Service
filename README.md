# Wallet_Service
A wallet service is used to transfer and receive funds between two parties. Key challenge for building a wallet service are security &amp; trust. Users must feel that their funds are secure and the administrator of the wallet service doesn't steal their funds. The wallet service built by us tackles both these issues.
